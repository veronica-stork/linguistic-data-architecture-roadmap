# Linguistic Data Architecture Roadmap
## A curriculum for bridging Information Science, Data Engineering, and Quantum Natural Language Processing.

### The Vision
Modern AI is moving beyond "bags of words" and statistical guessing toward structural understanding. This repository provides a modular, 6-phase curriculum for engineers who want to specialize in the Lifecycle of Meaning, starting from information science and going all the way to Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP).

Whether you are analyzing 30 years of archives or architecting real-time decentralized compute subnets, this roadmap provides the engineering foundation required to bridge the gap between human language and quantum hardware.
