# Linguistic Data Architecture Roadmap
## A curriculum for bridging Information Science, Data Engineering, and Quantum Natural Language Processing.

### The Vision
Modern AI is moving beyond "bags of words" and statistical guessing toward structural understanding. This repository provides a modular, 6-phase curriculum for engineers who want to specialize in the Lifecycle of Meaning, starting from information science and going all the way to Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP).

Whether you are analyzing 30 years of archives or architecting real-time decentralized compute subnets, this roadmap provides the engineering foundation required to bridge the gap between human language and quantum hardware.

### Getting Started
This repo is designed as a self-directed education in linguistic data architecture. To begin your journey:
1. **Fork this repo**: This will create your own personal laboratory to experiment and track your progress.
2. **Choose your data**: You are going to need a big data set to work with. You can either use personal data or publicly available datasets. (See `DATASETS.md` for recommendations.)
3. **Initialize your environment**: We recommend a clean Python virtual environment.
4. **Follow the modules**: If you have no previous experience in information science, or if you need a refresher, start with module 0.
