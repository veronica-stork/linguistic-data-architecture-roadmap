# Linguistic Data Architecture Roadmap Curriculum
## Master List

1. [Information Science Boot Camp](https://github.com/veronica-stork/linguistic-data-architecture-roadmap/tree/main/curriculum/phase1)"
2. [Linguistic Architecture]("https://example.com")
3. [Introduction to Data Engineering with Python]("https://example.com")
4. [Infrastructure & DePIN]("https://example.com")
5. [Advanced AI and Big Data]("https://example.com")
6. [Quantum foundations and linguistic math]("https://example.com")
7. [Master whitepaper and portfolio]("https://example.com")

This curriculum is designed to take the learner on a journey through linguistics, information architecture, AI, and quantum computing. At the end, you will be able to:

- Engineer robust ETL pipelines to normalize large amounts of "dark data."

- Design semantic Knowledge Graphs using GraphRAG to preserve context across disparate datasets.

- Model complex linguistic ambiguity as quantum circuits using the DisCoCirc framework.

- Strategize the deployment of these systems on decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) to ensure user information sovereignty.

Theoretically, you should be able to complete this curriculum in about 13 months at 10 hours of work per week. As of 1/22/26, this has yet to be tested.
